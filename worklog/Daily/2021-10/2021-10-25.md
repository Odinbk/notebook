# Facebook Developer API

## Authorization

* 创建App，要使用Marketing API的话需要创建Business App。
* 开发者创建Facebook 开发账号，管理员授权给开发者添加开发者权限。
* App Dashboard > App Review > Permissions and Features. https://developers.facebook.com/apps/1823105081198643/settings/basic/?business_id=445571356186221
* 权限Scopes，ads_management, ad_reads etc. 


## Authentication

* expore time, temperary, never. Token Debugger Tool: https://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug/accesstoken/
* long lived access token: https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login/access-tokens/refreshing
* Explorer: https://developers.facebook.com/tools/explorer/

The token should be stored in your database for subsequent API calls. You should regularly check for validity of the token, and if necessary prompt the user for permission. Even a persistent token can become invalid in a few cases including the following:

The user’s password changes
The user revokes permissions

## Best Practice

* AD Review

Ad Changes Triggering Ad Reviews
If you make any changes to the following scenarios, your ad will be triggered for review:

Any changes to your creative (image, text, link, video, and so on)
Any changes to targeting
Any changes of optimization goals and billing events may also trigger review
Note: Changes to bid amount, budget, and ad set schedule will not have any effect on the review status.

Additionally, if an ad enters Ad Review with the run status of "Paused", then it will remain Paused upon exiting Ad Review. Otherwise, the ad will be considered Active and ready to deliver.

### Rate Limit

All Marketing API requests, and Pages API requests made with a system or page access token, are subject to Business Use Case (BUC) Rate Limits, and depend on the endpoints you are querying.

Ads Insights
Requests made by your app to the Ads Insights API are counted against the app’s call count. An app’s call count is the number of calls it can make during a rolling one hour window and is calculated as follows:

For apps with Standard and Advanced Access:

Calls within one hour = 60 + 400 * Number of Active ads - 0.001 * User Errors
The Number of Active ads is the number of ads currently running per ad account. User Errors is the number of errors received when calling the API. To get a higher rate limit, you can apply for the Ads Management Standard Access feature.

Error Code | BUC Rate Limit Type
error code 80000, error subcode 2446079 | Ads Insights

### Pagination

https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/results

支持基于计数器的分页，基于时间的分页，基于偏移量的分页。

## Sandbox Environment

* https://developers.facebook.com/ads/blog/post/2016/10/19/sandbox-ad-accounts/
* Try API calls with Graph API Explorer. You can try any API call you would like to make to the Marketing API, see blog post. Select your app in App, and grant your app ads_management or ads_read permission in extended permissions when you create an access token. Use ads_read if you only need Ads Insights API access for reporting. Use ads_management to read and update ads in an account.
* You can use sandbox mode to demonstrate your app for app review. However in sandbox mode you cannot create ads or ad creative. Therefore you should use hard coded ad IDs and ad creative IDs to demonstrate your use of our API for app review.
