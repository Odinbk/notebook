## CMDB

* ITIL defines an asset as “any resource or capability that could contribute to the delivery of a service.” 

  Examples of assets include:
   virtual or physical storage
   virtual or physical servers
   a software license
   undocumented information known to internal team members

* ITIL defines configuration items as “an asset that needs to be managed in order to deliver an IT service.”
All configuration items are assets, but many assets are not configuration items. Examples of configuration items include a virtual or physical server or a software license. 
Every configuration item should be under the control of change management

* At a minimum, a CMDB contains the following:
   Configuration item (CI) records with all associated attributes captured.
   A relationship model between different CIs.
   A history of all service impacts in the form of incidents, changes, and problems.
* In a traditional IT setup, the goals of establishing a CMDB are met through the process of:
   Discovery tools used to create a record of existing CIs.
   Comprehensive change management processes to keep track of creation and updates to CIs.
   Integration of incident and problem management data with impacted CIs with ITSM workflow tools like BMC, Hewlett-Packard, or ServiceNow.
* There are some challenges to creating a CMDB for cloud resources due to:
   The inherent dynamic nature of cloud resource provisioning, where resources can be created or terminated through predefined business policies or application architecture elements like auto scaling.
   The difficulty of capturing cloud resources data in a format that can be imported and maintained in a single system of record for all enterprise CIs.

   A prevalence of shadow IT organizations that makes information sharing and even manual consolidation of enterprise IT assets and CIs difficult.
